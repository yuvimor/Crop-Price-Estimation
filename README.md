# Crop Price Estimation

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a project aimed at predicting crop prices in different districts of Tamil Nadu. The primary objectives were to forecast crop prices for the next three months and provide suggestions on which crops to sell currently.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises information about crop prices in various districts of Tamil Nadu. It includes details such as district names, crop types, price dates, and crop prices per quintal.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main modules:

1. **Module 1: Data Loading, Cleaning, Preprocessing, and EDA**
   - Jupyter Notebook: [Module_1_Data_Preprocessing_and_EDA.ipynb](link/to/Module_1_Data_Preprocessing_and_EDA.ipynb)
   - This module focuses on loading the dataset, cleaning the data, preprocessing features, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns and trends in the dataset.

2. **Module 2: Model Building**
   - Jupyter Notebook: [Module_2_Model_Building.ipynb](link/to/Module_2_Model_Building.ipynb)
   - Module 2 builds upon Module 1 and includes the development of a predictive model using machine learning techniques.

## Streamlit App

The project also includes a Streamlit app that provides an interactive interface for users to explore forecasted crop prices and receive recommendations on current crop sales. The app allows users to select a district and crop to view the forecasted prices for the next three months.
